# Probio-genomics

Advancement of sequencing techniques has made it easy to perform whole genome sequencing of bacteria. However, the characterization of sequenced bacteria as probiotic is limited because the trait-specific databases are not available. Most autonomous annotation pipelines do identify some probiotic-trait associated genes, however their annotations are inconsistent across different pipelines. Probio-genomics provides an easy platform to profile probiotic-trait associated genes from *Lactobacillus* genome.

Probio-genomic uses the publicly available and custom databases to identify probiotic-trait associated genes. Probiotic traits and associated databases are as follow –

Bile tolerance – 
Acid tolerance – 
Bacteriocin – BacteriocinDB (derived from BAGEL4 and Bactibase)
Adhesion – Lactobacillus Adhesin Database (LAD)
