Probio-genomics
===============


Advancement of sequencing techniques has made it easy to perform whole genome sequencing of bacteria. However, the characterization of sequenced bacteria as probiotic is limited because not all trait-specific databases are available. Most autonomous annotation pipelines do identify some probiotic trait-associated genes, however their annotations are inconsistent across different pipelines. Probio-genomic provides an easy platform to profile probiotic trait-associated genes from *Lactobacillus* genome.

Probio-genomic uses the publicly available and custom databases to identify probiotic trait-associated genes. Probiotic traits and associated databases are as below - 
```
Bile tolerance – Bile salt hydrolase (BSH)
Acid tolerance – 
Bacteriocin – BacteriocinDB (derived from BAGEL4 and Bactibase)
Adhesion – Lactobacillus Adhesin Database (LAD)
```
