Probiogenomics
===============



Advancement of sequencing techniques has made it easy to perform whole genome sequencing of bacteria. However, the characterization of sequenced bacteria as probiotic is limited because not all trait-specific databases are available. Most autonomous annotation pipelines do identify some probiotic trait-associated genes, however their annotations are inconsistent across different pipelines. Probiogenomic provides an easy platform with curated databases to profile probiotic trait-associated genes from *Lactobacillus* genome.

Probiogenomic uses the publicly available and custom databases to identify probiotic trait-associated genes. Probiotic traits and associated databases are as below -

### Bile tolerance
Bacteria deploys different mechanisms to conunteract the detrimental effects of bile acids. Among them, the activity of bile salt hydrolase is one of the essential and confers tolerance through bile salts deconjugation. Lactobacilli encodes *bsh* which codes for bile salt hydrolase (BSH).




### Acid tolerance

### Bacteriocin
Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by variety of bacteria including lactobacilli. There are two bacteriocin databases ([BAGEL4](http://bagel4.molgenrug.nl/) and [Bactibase](http://bactibase.hammamilab.org/main.php)) are available and both comprises experimentally characterized bacteriocins. BacterocinDB used in probiogenomics is derived from BAGEL4 and Bactibase after removing redundent sequences and curated annotations.
