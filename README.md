Probiogenomics
===============



Advancement of sequencing techniques has made it easy to perform whole genome sequencing of bacteria. However, the characterization of sequenced bacteria as probiotic is limited as not all trait-specific databases are available. Most autonomous annotation pipelines do identify some probiotic trait-associated genes, but their annotations are inconsistent across different pipelines. Probiogenomics provide an easy platform for genome-scale analyses of lactobacilli with the use of curated probiotic-trait associated databases.

Probiogenomics use the publicly available and custom databases to identify probiotic trait-associated genes from *Lactobacillus* genome. Custom databases are built from experimentally characterized trait-associated genes ([Ref]()). Details of probiotic traits and associated databases are as below -

### Bile tolerance
Bacteria deploy different mechanisms to counteract the detrimental effects of bile acids. Among them, bile salt hydrolysis is one of the essential and confers tolerance through bile salts deconjugation. Lactobacilli encodes *bsh* which codes for bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and performs hydrolysis of conjugated bile salts. Other mechanisms include bile efflux, changes in architecture of cell wall/cell membrane and general stress responses. BileResistDB comprises profile HMM for BSH, bile efflux proton pumps, stress related factors and cell wall architecture associated proteins.

### Acid tolerance
Acid tolerance in lactobacilli is mainly exhibited by surface associated efflux pumps and general stress associated factors. AcidResistDB comprises profile HMM for efflux pumps and stress associated proteins.

### Bacteriocin
Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by variety of bacteria including lactobacilli. There are two bacteriocin databases ([BAGEL4](http://bagel4.molgenrug.nl/) and [Bactibase](http://bactibase.hammamilab.org/main.php)) are available and both comprises experimentally characterized bacteriocins. BacterocinDB used in probiogenomics is derived from BAGEL4 and Bactibase after removing redundent sequences and curated annotations.
